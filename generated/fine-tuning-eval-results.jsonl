The girl was a little scared and was thinking of turning back, but yet they went on. The girl's dog was acting very interested in what was in the bushes up ahead. To both the girl and the dog's surprise, there was a small brown bear resting in the bushes. The bear was not surprised and did not seem at all interested in the girl and her dog. The bear looked up at the girl and it was almost as if he was smiling at her. He then rested his head on his bear paws and went back to sleep. The girl and the dog kept walking and finally made it out of the woods.

Williams of the Harris County Sheriff's Department. \n\nAn investigation found that Rick James Lohstroh, 41, was shot by his son, who was sitting in the back seat of the man's Toyota 4-Runner, said Sgt. Williams. The shooting took place outside the home of Lohstroh's ex-wife, where the boy lives with his mother and a 7-year-old brother. \n\n\"We're not certain of anything until we finish our investigation,\" Williams said. \"The information we have at this time is that the 10-year-old did fire the weapon.\" \n\nThe mother and the 7-year-old were inside the house when the shooting occurred, said Williams. \n\nWilliams said the gun belonged to the boy's mother. After firing shots through the back seat, the boy exited the back of the vehicle and continued to fire at the car. \n\nThe man died on the way to Memorial Herman Hospital. \n\nLohstroh was a doctor at the University of Texas Medical Branch. \n\nThe man and woman shared custody of the children. \n\nWilliams said the mother and the boy were still in the home talking to investigators Friday night. \n\nNeighbors described the family as being quiet and keeping to themselves. \n\nJustin Gray, 17, was walking in the neighborhood when he heard gunshots. \"We've had a suicide in this neighborhood once, but never anything like this,\" Gray said.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "What happened Friday?", "role": "user"}]}, {"original_answer": "Fra Girolamo", "fine_tuned_answer": "Savonarola", "base_answer": "According to the story, Savonarola was excommunicated.", "input": [{"content": "look at this story and answer questions based on the infromation in the story: CHAPTER FIFTY FIVE. \n\nWAITING. \n\nThe lengthening sunny days went on without bringing either what Romola most desired or what she most dreaded. They brought no sign from Baldassarre, and, in spite of special watch on the part of the Government, no revelation of the suspected conspiracy. But they brought other things which touched her closely, and bridged the phantom-crowded space of anxiety with active sympathy in immediate trial. They brought the spreading Plague and the Excommunication of Savonarola. \n\nBoth these events tended to arrest her incipient alienation from the Frate, and to rivet again her attachment to the man who had opened to her the new life of duty, and who seemed now to be worsted in the fight for principle against profligacy. For Romola could not carry from day to day into the abodes of pestilence and misery the sublime excitement of a gladness that, since such anguish existed, she too existed to make some of the anguish less bitter, without remembering that she owed this transcendent moral life to Fra Girolamo. She could not witness the silencing and excommunication of a man whose distinction from the great mass of the clergy lay, not in any heretical belief, not in his superstitions, but in the energy with which he sought to make the Christian life a reality, without feeling herself drawn strongly to his side. \n\nFar on in the hot days of June the Excommunication, for some weeks arrived from Rome, was solemnly published in the Duomo. Romola went to witness the scene, that the resistance it inspired might invigorate that sympathy with Savonarola which was one source of her strength. It was in memorable contrast with the scene she had been accustomed to witness there. ", "role": "system"}, {"content": "Who was excommunicated?", "role": "user"}]}]
